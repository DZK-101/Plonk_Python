# Plonk_TH
This repo contains an python implementation of the PLONK protocol (the zk- version) as described in the [PLONK paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953) from p.27 and an accompanying tutorial.

The PLONK implementation consists of the setup.py, prover.py, verifier.py files. Run plonk.py which containts a testcase which puts everything together using the example problem
from [Vitalik's blog](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html) on PLONK. This implementation has been developed for educational purposes only, it is not secure or efficient.

The accompanying tutorial plonk_tutorial.ipynb contains essentially the same code but explains the steps in some detail.

Contributions are welcome.
